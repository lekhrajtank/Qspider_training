//! node JS ==> it is a javascript runtime environment, open source, cross-platform

# open source ==> the source code is publicly available
# cross-platform ==> it can run on multiple platforms like windows, mac, linux
# rte ==> it provides a particular environment to execute javascript files.

!!!! modules ==> it is a logical piece of code which can be reused in other programs. with the help of modules we can break our code into smaller parts and it also increases code readability                                                           a                  and reusability.
>>>>>>>> In nodejs we have three types of modules ==> local module, built-in module and third party module

   .   local-module ==> modules which are user defined

   .   third-party modules ==> modules which are installed from a differentsource(npm). for example ==> express, mongodb, dotenv, etc..

   .   built-in modules ==> modules which are available in the nodejs environment or pre-installed modules. for example ==> fs, http, crypto, path, os, etc..
